# COMP311-circuits

Some circuits from COMP311 (Computer Organization) at [UNC](https://unc.edu). Designs are from Professors Brent Munsell and Montek Singh.

Use [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital), a really great circuit simulator program made by [hneemann](https://github.com/hneemann/), to open `.dig` files.

For your convenience, here is the download link for Digital. This is not my software. I am not taking credit for it, and I'm providing the link here simply for convenience.

To see how to run the program, among other documentation, click the link to Digital's repo above.
